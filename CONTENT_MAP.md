# Content Map: Curriculum to Slides

This file maps sections of `STUDENT_ONBOARDING_PLAN.md` to slide numbers in each week's deck. When you change content in either source, consult this map to identify what else needs updating.

## How to use this map

1. **Editing the curriculum?** Find your section below. Check which slides cover the same material. Update those slides (or flag them for update).
2. **Editing a slide deck?** Find the slide by its screen label. Check which curriculum section it maps to. Make sure the curriculum still matches.
3. **Adding new material?** Add a row to this map when you create the content. Decide which week's slides (if any) should cover it.
