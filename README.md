# FEAST Educational Materials

Instructional materials for the [FEAST](https://fassfrontstage.pods.icicleai.tapis.io/) (Food Equity Access Simulation Technology) student developer onboarding program. A six-week curriculum that teaches LLM-assisted development practices while students make real contributions to a food access simulation tool.

**Live site:** [uw-madison-dsi.github.io/FEAST_educational_materials](https://uw-madison-dsi.github.io/FEAST_educational_materials/)

## What this is

This repo contains everything an instructor needs to run a cohort of student developers through the FEAST onboarding program: a master curriculum, scaffolded guides, presentation slides, repo templates, and reference materials. It contains no application code.

The FEAST application lives in two separate repos:
- **Backend:** [ICICLE-ai/Food-Access-Model](https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/Food-Access-Model) (FastAPI + Mesa ABM + PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend:** fass-frontend (React + Leaflet + Vite)
- **Reference deployment:** [feast-test.services.dsi.wisc.edu](https://feast-test.services.dsi.wisc.edu/)

## How the program works

Students spend six weeks progressing from "run the project and understand what it does" to "independently plan and ship improvements." Each week has a group session (30-50 min) and async solo work.

**Key design decisions:**

- **Progressive LLM access.** Weeks 1-2: LLM as explainer only. Weeks 3-4: spec review, edge case brainstorming, adversarial PR review. Weeks 5-6: full LLM workflow including guided code generation. The constant rule: you must be able to explain every line without looking at your chat history.
- **Three-layer review pipeline.** CI checks (from Week 2), peer review (from Week 2), and LLM adversarial review (from Week 3) build incrementally so students never submit PRs without structured feedback.
- **ADR progression.** Students write Architecture Decision Records manually in Weeks 2-3, then learn to generate them from diffs/PRs with LLM tools in Week 4, and choose the right approach for each situation in Weeks 5-6.
- **Agentic tools from day one.** A CLI agent (Claude Code if available, Gemini CLI as a free alternative) is installed in Week 1. Students create a project context file for their FEAST repo fork as part of their first solo work.

See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for the full rationale behind these and other curriculum choices.

## Using these materials

**To run a cohort:**

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Copy templates from `templates/` into the FEAST application repos (backend and frontend).
3. Verify FEAST code references (file paths, line numbers in guides) against the current codebase state.
4. Review [STUDENT_ONBOARDING_PLAN.md](STUDENT_ONBOARDING_PLAN.md) for the full week-by-week plan.
5. Open the [Week 1 slides](slides/week-1/) for the first group session.

**To adapt for a different project:**

This repo is designed as a replicable pattern. The curriculum structure, project management files (CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, DECISIONS.md), guide scaffolding, and review pipeline progression are domain-agnostic. The FEAST-specific content is in the domain sections of the curriculum, the code references in guides, and the slide deck examples. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) to understand why the program is structured the way it is before modifying it.

## Keeping materials in sync

The curriculum (`STUDENT_ONBOARDING_PLAN.md`) and slide decks share overlapping content. [CONTENT_MAP.md](CONTENT_MAP.md) documents which sections map to which slides and lists specific shared values (URLs, scores, thresholds, line references) that must stay consistent. Consult it after modifying either source.

## Project management

This repo uses the same lightweight project management pattern it teaches:

- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** tracks milestones and progress
- **[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)** records curriculum design decisions with context and rationale
- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** serves as both developer documentation and AI agent configuration
- A post-commit hook reminds about ROADMAP.md updates

## Deployment

The site is built with Jekyll and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. Pushing to `main` triggers a rebuild automatically.
