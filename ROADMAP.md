# ROADMAP

Last updated: 2026-05-20

## Current State

**What works:**
- Complete 6-week onboarding plan with agentic tools, review pipelines, project management artifacts, issue mappings, student assignment strategy, and LLM/tooling usage progression (`STUDENT_ONBOARDING_PLAN.md`, restructured per DEC-004/005/006)
- 14 scaffolded student guides covering environment setup through agentic workflow best practices (`docs/guides/`)
- Templates for FEAST repos: CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, ADR template, vision plan template (`templates/`)
- Annotated reference bibliography with pedagogical and domain sources (`references/`)
- GitHub issue and PR templates (`.github/`)
- Project management scaffold: CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, DECISIONS.md, post-commit hook
- Week 1 slide deck (58 sections: orientation, domain, architecture, agentic tools, setup, experience baseline, vision plan, plan comparison)
- Week 2 slide deck (33 slides: experience review, vision plan comparison, git workflow, review pipeline, edge cases, iterative coding, ADRs, assigned work)
- Week 1 assignment document (`docs/assignments/week-1-assignment.md`)
- Week 2 assignment document (`docs/assignments/week-2-assignment.md`)
- Vision and Improvement Plan template (`templates/vision-plan-template.md`)
- Instructor prep guide for Week 2 LLM digest workflow (`docs/instructor-guides/week-2-prep.md`)
- Cohort org fork pattern with `[COHORT-ORG]` placeholder across curriculum, guides, and templates
- README with instructor setup instructions
- GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions

**In progress:**
- Slide decks for weeks 3-6

**Not started:**
- Consistency review across all written materials
- Packaging guidance for reuse in other domains

**Open questions:**
- How much slide content should duplicate vs. reference the onboarding plan?
- What level of FEAST-environment readiness is needed before the first cohort starts?
- What agentic tool access will students have via GitHub educational accounts? (Affects Week 1 setup scaffold)

- [ ] Collect instructor observations (pacing, scaffolding levels, actual LLM usage patterns observed)
- [ ] Update guides based on common stumbling points
- [ ] Update onboarding plan based on actual vs. planned pacing
- [ ] Document deviations from plan and rationale

### M6: Reusable Template [Not Started]
**Goal:** Package the pattern so others can adapt it for different projects and domains.

- [ ] Separate domain-specific content (FEAST, food access, Mesa) from domain-agnostic structure
- [ ] Write adaptation guide: how to create an onboarding program for a different project
- [ ] Document which pieces are FEAST-specific vs. reusable scaffolding
- [ ] Create a template branch or repo with placeholders where domain content goes

## Dependency Graph

```
M1 (Core Curriculum)
 |
 +------> M2 (Presentations) -------+
 |                                   |
 +------> M3 (Repo Scaffold) -------+--> M4 (Pilot Readiness)
                                              |
                                              v
                                        M5 (Post-Pilot Iteration)
                                              |
                                              v
                                        M6 (Reusable Template)
```

M1 feeds M2 (slides reference the written curriculum) and M3 (repo scaffold needs to know the scope).
M2 and M3 both feed M4 (pilot needs slides and a functioning repo pattern).
M4 blocks M5 (must run the pilot to get feedback).
M5 blocks M6 (must iterate before packaging as a template).

## Critical Path to MVP (Pilot-Ready)

**M1** (finish consistency review) -> **M2** (at minimum, Week 1 slides) -> **M4** (instructor prep + dry-run)

The minimum viable pilot requires: the onboarding plan, guides, Week 1 slides, and a working FEAST environment for students. Weeks 2-6 slides can be created just-in-time during the pilot if needed, but Week 1 must be complete before students arrive. M3 is already done.
