# FEAST Student Developer Onboarding Plan

## Constraints

- **Group time**: ~2 hours/week, 6 weeks (buffer from 8)
- **Solo time**: Additional async hours later in the week (varies by student availability)
- **Team**: 5 CS students, freshmen to seniors, varying experience
- **Goal**: Revamp the FEAST tool while teaching LLM-assisted development practices
- **Repos**: `ICICLE-ai/Food-Access-Model` (backend, branch `minimum_viable_product`), `ICICLE-ai/FASS-Frontend` (frontend, branch `Brown-County-Frontend`)
- **Active backend variant**: The `bc_pantries` branch extends the model with food pantry support (FSA score of 25 for pantries, prioritized for low-income households). Check which branch is canonical before the cohort starts.

## How This Plan Works

Each week has three parts:
1. **Group session** (~2 hours): Short lesson + demo of a new LLM workflow pattern, then guided work on assigned issues using scaffolded guides
2. **Solo work** (async, later in the week): Students apply that week's patterns independently to push the codebase forward. This is where the real learning happens. Each week's solo section gives a clear "hunting ground" and the LLM workflow to use, but students choose *what* to work on.
3. **PR review + issue creation** (async): Review each other's PRs, and file issues for anything discovered during solo work

**Students own the roadmap.** Starting week 1, students file GitHub issues for every problem, inconsistency, or improvement they discover. By week 3, students participate in triaging and prioritizing issues. By week 5, students are proposing and scoping their own features. The backlog is a living artifact the team shapes together, not a static assignment list.

Issues from the real backlog are mapped to each week as **assigned work** (scaffolded, everyone does these). Solo work is **self-directed** (students pick from issues they or others have filed, or tackle stretch goals).

Students are labeled by experience tier:
- **J** (junior, freshmen/sophomores): More scaffolding, smaller scope
- **S** (senior, juniors/seniors): Less scaffolding, more autonomy

## Week 1: Orientation, Setup, and Understanding the System

This is the most important week. Students need to get the project running, understand what it does conceptually, and see how the pieces fit together before touching any code. Senior students act as guides for juniors throughout.

### The mission (~5 min)

Open with this before anything else. The team's primary objective:

**Improve the FEAST framework to make it more usable, flexible, and performant, using modern development tooling including agentic coding tools.**

FEAST is a working research tool with real users, but it has rough edges: hardcoded geography, inconsistent data handling, missing tests, no CI, and a frontend that mixes patterns. The team's job over 6 weeks is to ship concrete improvements that make it better for the people who use it, while learning how to work effectively with AI-assisted development tools as part of a professional workflow.

Everything that follows in this session - the domain background, the architecture walkthrough, the tool setup - is in service of this objective. Students aren't just learning about the system; they're preparing to improve it.

### Group Session Part 1: Domain, Concepts, Architecture, and Tools (~70 min)

**Topic: "What this project does, why it matters, and how it's built"**

Walk through these concepts as a group. This is lecture + discussion, not hands-on yet. The goal is that every student leaves this session able to explain the project to someone outside the team.

#### Food accessibility: the problem (~10 min)

**What is food access?** The ability of a household to regularly obtain adequate, affordable, nutritious food. It's not just about whether a grocery store exists nearby. It depends on:
- **Distance** to stores (especially supermarkets vs. convenience stores)
- **Transportation** (does the household have a vehicle? Is there public transit?)
- **Income** (can the household afford to make regular trips to more distant but better-stocked stores?)
- **Store quality** (a supermarket with fresh produce is different from a convenience store with mostly packaged food)

**Why it matters.** The USDA estimates that roughly 19 million Americans live in "food deserts," areas where access to affordable, nutritious food is limited. Low food access correlates with poor diet, higher rates of obesity and diabetes, and other health outcomes. It disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color.

**What decisions does this affect?** Cities and counties make decisions every year about zoning, subsidies, and infrastructure that affect food access:
- Should we subsidize a new grocery store in this underserved neighborhood?
- What happens to food access if this Walmart closes?
- Where should we invest in public transit to improve food access?
- How does adding a farmers' market affect the surrounding area?

These are the questions FEAST is built to help answer. The tool lets a user set up a geographic area, place stores and households, and simulate how food access scores change when stores are added, removed, or relocated.

#### Agent-based modeling: the approach (~15 min)

**What is agent-based modeling (ABM)?**

ABM is a simulation technique where you model individual "agents" that each follow simple rules, and then observe the emergent behavior of the whole system. Instead of writing one big equation that describes food access for a whole city, you create thousands of individual household agents that each independently figure out where to shop.

Key properties of ABMs:
- **Heterogeneous agents**: Each household has its own income, location, vehicle count, etc. No two agents are identical. This captures real-world diversity.
- **Local interactions**: Each agent only "sees" its local environment (nearby stores, its own resources). Global patterns emerge from many local decisions.
- **Steps over time**: The simulation advances in discrete steps. Each step, every agent re-evaluates its situation. This lets you model change: what happens over 6 months if a store opens or closes?
- **What-if scenarios**: You can add/remove stores and re-run to see counterfactual outcomes.

**How FEAST uses ABM:**

In FEAST, there are two types of agents:
- **Household agents**: Represent a single household. Each has attributes from Census data (income, household size, vehicles, workers) and a geographic location within a census tract.
- **Store agents**: Represent a food store (supermarket, convenience store, grocery, etc.). Each has a type, name, and location from OpenStreetMap.

On each simulation step, every household agent:
1. Calculates its distance to every store
2. Identifies the closest supermarket and the closest non-supermarket
3. Decides where to "shop" each of its monthly trips (based on distance, resources, and vehicle access)
4. Computes a food access score based on how many trips went to supermarkets (high food quality) vs. convenience stores (lower food quality)

The scoring uses the **MFAI (Monthly Food Access Index)** from Koh et al. 2019. The basic idea:
- A trip to a supermarket scores 95 (good food availability)
- A trip to a convenience store scores 55 (limited food availability)
- A trip to a food pantry scores 25 (minimal food availability; `bc_pantries` branch only)
- A household's MFAI is the average of its monthly trip scores
- Households with more resources (income, vehicles) make more trips (7-8/month) and are more likely to reach distant supermarkets
- Households without vehicles or with low income make fewer trips (6/month) and tend to use the closest store regardless of type
- Low-income households (income at or below $25k) may prioritize food pantries when available (`bc_pantries` branch)

This means a household's score isn't just about distance. A car-owning household far from a supermarket may score higher than a carless household next to a convenience store, because the car-owner can reach the supermarket.

The `has_resources()` function (household.py:169) determines resource status using income thresholds that vary by household size: $10k for singles, $15k for 2-person, $25k for 3+ person households.

**The Mesa framework:** FEAST uses [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/) via [mesa-geo](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-geo) v0.8.0, a Python ABM library with geographic extensions. Mesa provides:
- A `Model` class that holds all agents and manages simulation steps (see `abm/geo_model.py`)
- A `GeoAgent` class that defines individual agent behavior with geographic coordinates (the `step()` method)
- A `GeoSpace` that enables spatial operations like distance calculations between agents
- A `DataCollector` that records agent state at each step
- A `RandomActivation` scheduler that runs agents in random order each step

You don't need to understand Mesa deeply to contribute. The key thing to know: when `GeoModel.step()` is called, it triggers `Household.step()` on every household agent, which is where all the food access math happens. In practice, this step is run via `batch_running.py` which splits households across CPU cores for parallelism.

#### Use cases and stakeholders (~5 min)

**Who uses this tool?**
- **Urban planners**: Evaluating proposed grocery store locations or transit improvements
- **Public health researchers**: Studying the relationship between food access and health outcomes across demographics
- **Policy analysts**: Modeling the impact of store closures (e.g., when a chain pulls out of a low-income area)
- **Community organizations**: Advocating for food access improvements with data-driven arguments
- **Students and researchers**: Learning about spatial modeling, food systems, and agent-based simulation

**Example scenarios:**
- A city wants to know: "If we give a tax break to attract a grocery store to neighborhood X, how many households see improved food access?"
- A Walmart announces closure. "Which households are most affected? Where should a replacement be located?"
- A transit agency asks: "If we add a bus route connecting neighborhood Y to the nearest supermarket, how does that change access scores for carless households?"
- A researcher wants to compare food access patterns across different counties by initializing FEAST with different Census geographies.

**Where the project came from:** FEAST originated through the NSF-funded ICICLE AI institute (OAC 2112606). The current implementation is focused on Brown County, Wisconsin as a proof of concept, with the goal of making it work for any US county.

#### How the three layers work together (~10 min)

Draw this on a whiteboard or shared screen:

```
+-------------------+     HTTP/JSON      +-------------------+     SQL       +------------+
|                   | ----------------> |                   | -----------> |            |
|  Frontend (React) |  Axios (client.js) |  Backend (FastAPI) |  asyncpg     | PostgreSQL |
|                   | <---------------- |                   | <----------- |            |
+-------------------+  ORJSONResponse    +-------------------+   rows        +------------+
  - Leaflet map                           - API routes (/api/)               - households
  - Marker clustering                     - Mesa ABM model                   - food_stores
  - User controls                         - Multiprocessing batch runner     - simulation_instances
  - Score visualization                   - MFAI calculation                 - roads (unused)
  - proj4 coord transform                 - Census data pipeline
                                          - Store polygon generation
```

**Frontend** (`ICICLE-ai/FASS-Frontend`, `fass-react/` directory, branch `Brown-County-Frontend`):
- **Live instance:** https://fassfrontstage.pods.icicleai.tapis.io/ (Tapis/ICICLE staging). Students should open this before setup to see the working product.
- React 19 app built with Vite
- Leaflet map displays households (colored by food access score: green=high, red=low) and stores (supermarket hexagons, convenience store triangles)
- Marker clustering groups households at low zoom levels, expanding at zoom 17+
- User can add stores (click map to place), multi-select and remove stores (Ctrl/Cmd+click), step the simulation, and reset
- Talks to backend via Axios HTTP client. The API base URL is **hardcoded** in `src/shared/client.js` (not an env var). Students must edit this file to point at their local backend.
- State management uses React Context API (`StoreContext`, `HouseholdContext`) plus `window` object globals (an anti-pattern students will notice)
- Deployed via Docker (multi-stage: Node build, Nginx serve) behind nginx
- Key dependencies: React 19, Leaflet, react-leaflet, Axios, Bootstrap, Tailwind, proj4 (coordinate projection)

**Backend** (`Food-Access-Model/`, branch `minimum_viable_product`):
- FastAPI serves the REST API (`/api/` prefix)
- **Two entry points exist** (a source of confusion for students):
  - `food_access_model/main.py` is the primary entry (used by `run_local.py`). CORS allows `localhost:5173`.
  - `api_server.py` at the repo root is an older alternative. CORS allows only a Tapis staging URL.
  - `server.py` at the repo root is yet another alternative with custom logging.
  - Students should use `food_access_model.main:app` via `run_local.py`.
- Uses the Mesa ABM framework (via mesa-geo 0.8.0): `GeoModel` holds all agents, `Household` and `Store` extend Mesa's `GeoAgent`
- On each simulation step, Mesa calls `step()` on every household agent, which recalculates distances, picks stores, and computes MFAI
- Simulation steps use multiprocessing (`model_multi_processing/batch_running.py`): households are split across CPU cores, each chunk runs in a separate process. Configurable via `NUMBER_PROCESSES` env var.
- The preprocessing pipeline (`preprocessing/get_data.py`, 1134 lines) fetches Census data from the Census Bureau API and store locations from OpenStreetMap to initialize a new simulation area. Store data can also be loaded from CSV via `insert_stores.py`.
- Currently hardcoded to Brown County, Wisconsin (FIPS code 55009, center 44.5/-88.0, 15km radius)
- Key dependencies: FastAPI, Mesa + mesa-geo, asyncpg, psycopg2, shapely, osmnx, pyproj, gunicorn, orjson
- A special `default_simulation` instance is protected from deletion and serves as the base dataset for new instances

**Database** (PostgreSQL, async via asyncpg connection pool):
- `simulation_instances` table: UUID primary key, name (unique), description, created_at
- `households` table: one row per household per simulation step (id, simulation_instance_id, simulation_step, centroid_wkt in EPSG:4326, income, household_size, vehicles, number_of_workers, walking/biking/transit/driving times, food_score, stores_within_1_mile, closest_store_miles)
- `food_stores` table: one row per store per simulation step (store_id, simulation_instance_id, simulation_step, name, shop type, geometry as WKT polygon in EPSG:3857)
- `roads` table exists but is unused (potential future feature)
- Stores and households are duplicated across steps (step 0, step 1, step 2...) so you can compare state over time
- Household coordinates stored in EPSG:4326 (lat/lon), store geometries in EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator, meters). This inconsistency is a known issue (see #67).

**Key concept for students**: When a user clicks "Step" in the UI, the frontend calls `POST /api/simulation-instances/{id}/advance`. The backend reads households and stores from the DB, splits households across CPU cores, runs each household's `step()` method (distance calculation, store selection, MFAI scoring), bulk-inserts the results as a new simulation step, and the frontend re-renders the map with updated colors. Student D will trace this flow in detail during assigned work; the full 8-step lifecycle is documented in the endpoint trace table below.

#### Where each layer runs: deployment configurations (~5 min)

The three-layer diagram above shows how the layers talk to each other. But each layer can run in different environments, and each can be configured independently to point at a different environment. This is a common source of confusion.

Draw a second diagram showing the environments side by side:

```
              LOCAL                STAGING (Tapis)           PRODUCTION
           +------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
Frontend   | localhost   |       | fassfrontstage |       | (future)       |
           | :5173       |       | .pods...       |       |                |
           +------+------+       +-------+--------+       +-------+--------+
                  | client.js             |                        |
                  | baseURL               |                        |
                  v                       v                        v
           +------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
Backend    | localhost   |       | Tapis staging  |       | (future)       |
           | :8000       |       | API            |       |                |
           +------+------+       +-------+--------+       +-------+--------+
                  | .env                  |                        |
                  | DB_HOST               |                        |
                  v                       v                        v
           +------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
Database   | localhost   |       | staging DB     |       | prod DB        |
           | :5432       |       |                |       |                |
           +------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
```

Each arrow is a configuration decision. There are three levers that control which environment each layer talks to:

1. **Frontend -> Backend**: `src/shared/client.js:3` sets the API base URL (currently hardcoded, not an env var). Change this to point your frontend at a different backend.
2. **Backend -> Database**: `.env` file (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS). Change these to point your backend at a different database.
3. **Backend -> Frontend (CORS)**: CORS origins in `food_access_model/main.py` control which frontends the backend accepts requests from. If your frontend's origin isn't in the CORS list, requests fail silently.

Common configurations:

| Setup | Frontend | Backend | Database | When you'd use it |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|--------------------|
| Full local | localhost:5173 | localhost:8000 | localhost:5432 | Daily development |
| Local FE + staging API | localhost:5173 | Tapis staging | staging DB | Frontend-only work, no local backend needed |
| Full staging | Tapis FE | Tapis API | staging DB | Shared testing, demos |
| Mixed (common mistake) | localhost:5173 | localhost:8000 | staging DB | Accidentally pointing local backend at shared DB |

**Warning**: Mixing environments is powerful but risky. A local backend pointing at a staging database can corrupt shared data. A local frontend pointed at a staging backend with different CORS settings will fail silently. Always know which environment each of your three layers is targeting.

You don't need to memorize this table. The point is to understand that the three layers are independently configurable, and that most setup problems come from one layer pointing at the wrong environment. When something breaks, check the three levers.

#### Project management artifacts (~5 min)

Before jumping to tools, briefly show how this curriculum repo (FEAST_edu) manages itself using three lightweight artifacts:

- **Project context file**: Project context for both humans and AI agents. Describes what the project is, how to work in it, and what conventions to follow. Different tools read different filenames (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `.cursorrules` for Cursor), but the content is the same. You'll create one in Week 1 solo work.
- **ROADMAP.md**: What's done, what's in progress, what's next. A living document, not a one-time plan.
- **DECISIONS.md**: A log of design decisions and the reasoning behind them (also called ADRs, Architecture Decision Records). You'll start writing these in Week 2.

Show each file on screen briefly. Don't explain the format in detail; just establish that these exist and that the team will use them. The deeper lesson on project management artifacts comes in Week 4.

#### Agentic coding tools: setup and the landscape (~20 min)

##### Agentic engineering vs. vibe coding (~3 min)

There are two fundamentally different ways to use AI coding tools:

**Vibe coding** is prompting a tool, accepting what it produces, running it, and if it works, moving on. The developer acts as a prompter and acceptor. The code might work today, but nobody (including the person who prompted it) can explain why, maintain it, or debug it when it breaks. This is fast and sometimes fun, but it produces code that's a liability in any project with more than one contributor or a lifespan beyond a weekend.

**Agentic engineering** is using AI tools as collaborators in a disciplined workflow: you define what you want and why, the tool proposes an approach, you review it critically, push back on what doesn't make sense, and iterate until the result meets your standards. You maintain understanding and ownership throughout. The tool amplifies your capabilities; it doesn't replace your judgment.

This cohort teaches agentic engineering. Everything that follows -- the rules, the progressive tool restrictions, the spec-first workflow, the review pipeline, the planning tools -- is designed to build the habits of agentic engineering. Vibe coding is tempting because it feels productive. Agentic engineering is harder because it requires you to think, but it produces code you can stand behind.

Two rules that don't change across all 6 weeks:

1. **You must be able to explain every line in your PR without looking at your chat history.**
2. **Write code for future you.** Every function, variable name, and structural choice should be readable and understandable six months from now by someone with no context. "Working" is not enough; code that works but can't be understood is a liability. When you use an AI tool to write code, your job is to iteratively shape the output until it meets this standard, not to accept the first thing it produces.

These rules are the practical test for agentic engineering: if you can't explain it, you vibe-coded it.

##### What makes a tool an "agent"? (~3 min)

An LLM (large language model) takes text in and produces text out. One question, one answer. It has no memory of your files and no ability to run commands. An **agent** is built from five pieces:

1. **One LLM.** The brain. It reads text and produces text.
2. **A stable identity.** The agent persists across a conversation or task. It remembers what it has seen, what it tried, and what worked. A fresh prompt to a web chatbot has none of this; a CLI agent session does.
3. **A job.** A defined goal: answer a question, fix a bug, add type hints, plan a feature. The job scopes what the agent does and when it stops.
4. **A toolbox.** Capabilities the LLM cannot perform alone: reading files, running shell commands, searching code, editing files, executing tests. Tools are what let the agent verify its own answers against reality instead of guessing.
5. **A harness.** The software that puts it all together. The harness connects the LLM to the toolbox, manages context (deciding what fits in the LLM's limited window), and enforces safety rules (what the agent can do without asking permission). Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and Copilot all have different harnesses. The same LLM behaves differently depending on the harness it runs inside.

Your project context file (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md) is configuration for the harness: it tells the agent what to pay attention to. Without the harness, the LLM is just a chatbot.

When the pieces are assembled, the agent works in a loop: **observe** (read files, check errors) then **think** (plan next step) then **act** (edit, run commands) then observe the results. The loop repeats until the job is done.

**Three types of agents:**

- **Conversational agents:** Answer questions, explain code, brainstorm ideas. The loop is short (read a file, think, respond). This is what you use in Week 1.
- **Task agents:** Execute multi-step work. Read the codebase, plan changes, edit files, run tests, fix failures. The loop can run for many iterations. This is what you unlock in later weeks when the progressive restrictions lift.
- **Orchestrator agents:** Coordinate multiple task agents or manage complex workflows. Multi-issue planning (Week 4) is a taste of orchestration. You will not build orchestrators in this curriculum, but understanding the concept helps you recognize what advanced tooling does.

**The focus shift.** Because agents handle syntax, boilerplate, and implementation mechanics, the developer's job shifts to higher-level engineering work: problem decomposition, architecture decisions (ADRs), specification writing, code review, testing strategy, and documentation. These are exactly the skills this curriculum teaches. The agent handles "how do I write this in Python." You handle "what should we build, why, and how do we verify it works." This is what makes it engineering, and it is why the curriculum spends more time on planning, review, and communication than on writing code.

For a deeper look at agent concepts and design patterns, see [Guide 12: Agentic Engineering Concepts](docs/guides/12-agentic-engineering-concepts).

##### The tool landscape (~5 min)

There are several categories of AI-assisted coding tools. Students should understand the landscape, not just one tool:

- **CLI agents** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI): Run in your terminal alongside any editor. You describe what you want in natural language; the agent reads your codebase, proposes changes, and can execute commands. Both use project context files for grounding (see below). Claude Code is our recommendation if access is available; Gemini CLI is free and open source (Apache 2.0) with a generous daily quota on any Google account.
- **AI-native IDEs** (Cursor, Windsurf): Full editors with AI built into every interaction. Code completion, inline chat, multi-file editing. Heavier-weight, more opinionated about workflow.
- **Inline assistants** (GitHub Copilot, Codeium): Plugins for existing editors (VS Code, JetBrains). Primarily autocomplete and inline suggestions. Lightest-weight integration.

For this cohort, we recommend Claude Code if access is available. Its conversational interface matches how we want students to interact with AI (asking questions, not accepting autocomplete), and its project context files double as documentation. If Claude Code access isn't available, Gemini CLI is the recommended alternative: same terminal-based agent paradigm, free on any Google account, and the skills transfer directly. Students are welcome to also use Copilot, Cursor, or other tools they have access to.

**Access logistics:** Tool availability changes frequently. Check what's currently available through GitHub educational accounts (Copilot, GitHub Models) and whether the institution has a Claude for Education or similar plan. Gemini CLI requires only a personal Google account and has no signup gates. The important thing is that everyone has at least one CLI agent working by end of session. The concepts we teach (project context files, spec-first planning, adversarial review) work with any tool.

##### Project context files (~5 min)

Demo: Open the FEAST_edu repo's CLAUDE.md on screen. Point out how it describes the project structure, conventions, and workflow. Then show what happens when you ask your CLI agent a question about the project with vs. without a context file. The difference is immediate: with context, the agent gives grounded answers; without it, it guesses.

A project context file serves two audiences simultaneously:
1. **A new developer** joining the project (what is this, how do I work in it?)
2. **An AI agent** working in the codebase (what are the conventions, what should I pay attention to?)

This dual purpose is why a project context file is more useful than a generic README for day-to-day development. Different tools read different filenames: Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, Gemini CLI reads `GEMINI.md`, Cursor reads `.cursorrules`. The content is identical; you just name the file for your tool (or create multiple files if the team uses different tools). Students will create one for their FEAST repo during solo work this week.

##### Live demo: using an agent to understand code (~5 min)

Open your CLI agent in the FEAST backend repo. Show the difference between:
- "What does `has_resources()` in `household.py` do and why are the thresholds set the way they are?" (good: builds understanding)
- "Write me a function that checks if a household has resources." (bad: skips understanding)

If students have access to multiple tools, briefly compare: ask the same question in two different tools. Note the differences in how each handles context, codebase awareness, and response style. This takes 2-3 minutes and makes the "landscape" tangible rather than abstract.

##### Week 1 rules (~2 min)

For this week, agentic tools are for **asking questions about code you're reading**. Not for writing code. Not for generating tests. Not for fixing bugs. You're building the skill of reading and understanding code first. The tools are installed and configured so you can use them fluently when the restrictions lift in later weeks.

### Group Session Part 2: Setup (~30 min)

**Before touching any code, have everyone open the live instance:** https://fassfrontstage.pods.icicleai.tapis.io/. Spend 2-3 minutes clicking around as a group: look at the map, click a household, click "Step," add a store. This gives students a concrete mental model of the product before they wade into setup and configuration.

Senior students guide juniors through setup. Pair each J student with an S student. If setup takes longer than 30 min (it often does), students finish during solo time. The important thing is that everyone has at least one working environment by the end of the session, even if it's one S student's machine that others can pair on.

[SCAFFOLD: Environment Setup Guide]
```
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11+ installed
- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- PostgreSQL running locally (or access to a shared instance)
- Git configured with GitHub access
- uv installed (pip install uv)

Step 1: Clone the repos
   git clone https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/Food-Access-Model.git
   git clone https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/FASS-Frontend.git

Step 2: Backend setup
   cd Food-Access-Model
   git checkout minimum_viable_product    # active development branch
   cp .env.example .env                   # then edit with your DB credentials
   uv sync                                # install Python dependencies

   Required .env variables:
   DB_NAME=fassdb            # your local PostgreSQL database name
   DB_USER=postgres          # your PostgreSQL username
   DB_PASS=<your-password>
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   NUMBER_PROCESSES=4        # CPU cores for multiprocessing (optional)

   You'll need to create the database and tables. Check if there's
   a schema file or if the app creates tables on startup.

Step 3: Set up agentic coding tools
   At minimum, get one CLI agent working.

   Option A (preferred): Claude Code
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   cd Food-Access-Model
   claude     # verify it launches, ask a test question, then exit

   Option B (free, no signup required): Gemini CLI
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli   # or: see https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
   cd Food-Access-Model
   gemini     # verify it launches, ask a test question, then exit

   Option C (baseline): GitHub Copilot in VS Code (free via GitHub
   Education). Less agentic than the CLI tools, but functional.

   Verify: you can ask the tool a question about the codebase and
   get a response that references actual files. If it's hallucinating
   file names, something isn't configured right.

   Note: Whatever tool you use, the usage rules for this week still
   apply. Tools are for asking questions, not generating code.

Step 4: Run the backend
   uv run python run_local.py

   This runs: uvicorn food_access_model.main:app --reload --port 8000
   
   IMPORTANT: Use run_local.py or food_access_model.main:app.
   Do NOT use api_server.py (an older entry point with different
   CORS settings that will cause issues).
   
   For production-style: uv run gunicorn food_access_model.main:app \
     -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 --timeout 600

   Test it: curl http://localhost:8000/api/simulation-instances
   You should get a JSON response (possibly empty list if no data yet).
   Health check: curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

Step 5: Frontend setup
   cd FASS-Frontend/fass-react
   git checkout Brown-County-Frontend     # active development branch
   npm install

   Edit src/shared/client.js line 3:
   Change the baseURL to: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api'
   (The file has commented alternatives for staging/production URLs.
   There is no .env-based configuration; the URL is hardcoded.)

   WHY THIS STEP MATTERS: You're configuring which backend your
   frontend talks to. The staging instance at fassfrontstage.pods...
   has its own backend. Your local frontend could point at either.
   For development, you want everything local so your changes are
   isolated. See the deployment configurations diagram from the
   architecture section for the full picture.

   npm run dev
   Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Step 6: See it work
   You should see a Leaflet map centered on Brown County, WI
   (Green Bay area). If there's data in the database, you'll see
   colored household markers (clustered at low zoom, individual
   at zoom 17+) and store markers (hexagons for supermarkets,
   triangles for convenience stores).

   Try: Click a household marker to see its popup (income, vehicles,
   food access score). Click a store to see its name and type.

Common problems:
- "Connection refused" on backend: Is PostgreSQL running? Are .env
  creds correct? Is the backend on port 8000 (run_local.py) or
  8080 (gunicorn)? Make sure client.js matches.
- Empty map: Database might not have data. You may need to run the
  preprocessing pipeline or restore a database dump. Ask the
  instructor for the current data loading approach.
- CORS errors in browser console: If using food_access_model/main.py
  (via run_local.py), CORS already allows localhost:5173. If you
  accidentally used api_server.py, it only allows a Tapis staging
  URL and you'll get CORS errors.
- Import errors: Make sure you're on the minimum_viable_product
  branch (backend) and Brown-County-Frontend branch (frontend).
  The main branch has different code.
- Store data loading: If the database has no stores, use
  insert_stores.py with a CSV file to load store data:
  python insert_stores.py stores.csv
- Unexpected data / "someone else's simulation": Your local
  backend might be pointed at the staging database instead of
  your local one. Check .env -- DB_HOST should be localhost
  for local development, not a remote hostname.

S students: Help J students debug setup issues. If you solve
something non-obvious, write it down. These notes become part of
the CONTRIBUTING.md you'll write later.
```

### Assigned Work (~30 min remaining, continues into solo time)

**Everyone: Use the running app, then trace one endpoint**

First, spend 10 minutes just *using* the application. Use your local instance if it's running, or the live instance at https://fassfrontstage.pods.icicleai.tapis.io/ if local setup isn't done yet:
- Create a simulation instance (if the UI supports it, or via curl)
- Look at the map. Click on households. Read the popup data.
- Click "Step" to advance the simulation. Watch the colors change.
- Add a store near a cluster of red (low-access) households. Step again. Did scores improve?
- Remove a store. Step. What happens?

Understanding what the tool *does* is prerequisite to understanding how it *works*.

Then, each student traces one API endpoint through the full stack and writes a short description (3-5 paragraphs) of the flow in their own words:

| Student | Endpoint | Key Files | What to Focus On |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Student A (J) | `GET /simulation-instances` | `food_access_model/api/routes.py:98` -> SQL query -> ORJSONResponse | Simplest endpoint. How does a request become a database query become a JSON response? |
| Student B (J) | `GET /households` | `routes.py:273` -> query with simulation_instance + step params -> WKT geometry | How is household data structured? What do the column names mean? What is WKT? |
| Student C (J/S) | `POST /stores` (add store) | `routes.py:308` -> `helpers.py:29 convert_centroid_to_polygon` -> polygon geometry -> SQL insert | How does a lat/lon become a polygon? Why hexagons for supermarkets and triangles for convenience stores? |
| Student D (S) | `POST /simulation-instances/{id}/advance` | `routes.py:155` -> `_run_model_step` -> `batch_running.py:batch_run` (multiprocessing) -> `GeoModel.step()` -> `Household.step()` | The core simulation loop. How does a "step" work? Why multiprocessing? |
| Student E (S) | `POST /simulation-instances` (create) | `routes.py:191` -> copies households/stores from default_simulation -> `_run_model_step` | What happens when you create a new simulation? What is the default_simulation and why can't it be deleted? |

**S students**: After finishing your own trace, check in with your paired J student. Help them understand their endpoint if they're stuck. Don't do it for them; ask guiding questions.

**Tool usage**: Students can use their agentic coding tool (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) to ask questions about specific functions, but must verify explanations against the code. Deliverable is their own writing, not LLM output.

> **Beyond this project:** Writing down what you learned, in your own words, is how professionals transfer knowledge. It forces you to verify you actually understand it, and it creates something others can learn from. In any job, the people who write things down become go-to resources; the people who keep knowledge in their heads become bottlenecks.

### Deliverable
Each student opens a PR adding their endpoint trace as a markdown file in `docs/traces/` and their project context file in the FEAST repo root. These get reviewed by a peer before the Week 2 session.

### Solo Work (later in the week)

**Part 1: Explore more of the codebase and the domain.**

Now that you've traced one endpoint, explore the parts you didn't cover. Some suggestions by experience level:

**J students**: Read through the frontend code (`fass-react/src/App.jsx`, the component files in `src/components/`). Try to match what you see in the browser to what's in the code. Which component renders the map? (`MapComponent.js`, 526 lines). Which one handles "Add Store"? (`AddStoreButton.jsx` + `AddStoreModal.jsx`). Where do the household colors come from? (Hint: the backend sends them, but trace it.) Why does the code store things on the `window` object? Ask the LLM to explain things you don't understand, but verify against the code.

**S students**: Read `food_access_model/abm/household.py` carefully, especially `get_mfai()` (line 218), `has_resources()` (line 169), and `step()` (line 259). These are the core of the simulation. Try to understand the MFAI scoring logic. What do the magic numbers mean (95, 55, 0.8, 10000/15000/25000)? Read the data pipeline in `preprocessing/get_data.py` (1134 lines, focus on the main functions, not every line). How does Census data become synthetic households? Also look at `model_multi_processing/batch_running.py` to understand how simulation steps are parallelized.

**Part 2: Create a project context file in your FEAST repo.**

Using the template in `FEAST_edu/templates/CLAUDE.md` as a starting point, create a project context file in the root of whichever FEAST repo you're primarily working in (backend or frontend). Name it for your tool: `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI (or create both). Customize it based on what you learned from the architecture overview and your endpoint trace. The file should describe the project in a way that would help a new developer (or an AI agent) understand what the repo does and how to work in it.

This is your first project management artifact. Keep it short (under 50 lines). You'll update it as you learn more in later weeks. Open a PR for it alongside your endpoint trace.

**Part 3: File issues for everything you found.**

During your trace and exploration, you encountered things that seemed wrong, confusing, or inconsistent. Now turn each one into a GitHub issue. This is not busywork; this is how real projects build their backlog.

[SCAFFOLD: Issue Filing Guide]
```
For each problem you found, open a GitHub issue with:

Title: Clear, specific (e.g., "Import paths inconsistent between
   api_server.py and routes.py" not "fix imports")

Body:
- What you observed (quote the specific code)
- Where it is (file + line number)
- Why it's a problem
- (Optional) What you think the fix might be

Label it: bug, enhancement, or refactor

Examples of things you probably found:
- Three different entry points (api_server.py, server.py,
  food_access_model/main.py) with different CORS and logging configs
- api_server.py imports a `profiling` module that doesn't exist
  (dead code, import is commented out but still present)
- api_server.py CORS allows only a Tapis staging URL, while
  food_access_model/main.py allows localhost:5173
- pyproject.toml says Python 3.11.11, Dockerfile says 3.12
- deprecated on_event("startup"/"shutdown") pattern in routes.py
  (FastAPI lifespan context manager is the modern approach)
- print() used instead of logging in multiple files
- Magic numbers in household.py (95, 55, 0.8, 10000/15000/25000)
  with no explanation of what they represent
- Frontend stores state on the window object (window.simulationInstances,
  window.stepNumber, etc.) instead of using React state properly
- MapComponent.js uses raw DOM manipulation and imperative Leaflet
  API instead of React-Leaflet declarative components
- Frontend mixes Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS frameworks
- Frontend API URL hardcoded in client.js instead of using env vars
- No error handling or loading states if the API is unreachable
- Household coordinates stored as EPSG:4326, store geometries
  as EPSG:3857 (inconsistent CRS across tables)
- db_repository.py (sync psycopg2) and routes.py (async asyncpg)
  both query the same database with different connection patterns

Goal: Each student should file at least 3 issues. These become
the backlog your team works from in later weeks.
```

**Stretch (S students):** If you found something small enough to fix in 30 minutes (e.g., the CORS hardcoding, a print-to-logging conversion), fix it, open a PR, and link it to the issue you filed. First taste of the full cycle: find it, file it, fix it.

**S students helping J students:** If a J student is struggling to find issues, pair up over chat or a quick call. Walk them through one file together, pointing out things that seem off. The J student files the issues (they need the practice), but the S student helps them see what to look for.

### Roadmap Activity
Review each other's filed issues at the start of next week's session. As a group, label them by priority (must-fix, should-fix, nice-to-have) and add them to the GitHub project board.

---

## Week 2: Linting, Type Hints, and First Real PRs

### Group Session (50 min)

#### The review pipeline: automated + human (~15 min)

Every PR from this week forward goes through a structured review pipeline. This week starts with two layers; Week 3 adds a third.

**Layer 1: Automated CI checks.** A GitHub Actions workflow runs flake8 (and later, tests) on every PR. If CI fails, the PR doesn't merge. The linting student (#24) sets this up as their first priority this week, so it's available for everyone else's PRs.

**Layer 2: Human peer review.** Every PR gets reviewed by one other student before merge. The reviewer checks: Does the code match the stated intent? Are there obvious errors? Is the PR description clear? Post at least one substantive comment (not just "LGTM").

**Layer 3 (Week 3): LLM adversarial review.** A designated student runs an adversarial review in a fresh LLM session (any CLI agent or chat interface) and posts findings as PR comments.

> **Beyond this project:** You're learning to give and receive critical feedback clearly and constructively. This skill (finding problems, articulating them specifically, suggesting improvements) appears in every professional role. Code review is practice for the hardest version of it.

Demo: Show a GitHub Actions workflow that runs flake8 on a PR. Show what a failing check looks like. Show what a passing check looks like. Walk through the PR template.

#### Git workflow for teams (~15 min)

Week 1 introduced the basic git commands (clone, commit, push). This session covers how the team uses git together: branches, pull requests, and commit conventions.

[SCAFFOLD: Git Workflow Guide]

**Branch strategy.** The FEAST project uses three levels of branches:

- `main` is the stable, deployed version. You never push directly to main.
- `dev` is the integration branch. Your feature branches merge into dev via pull request.
- Feature branches are where you do your work. Always create them from an up-to-date `dev`:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b feature/issue-NUMBER-short-desc
```

Name your branch after the issue you're working on: `feature/issue-24-linting`, `feature/issue-47-store-count-fix`. This makes it obvious what each branch is for.

**Commit conventions.** Good commit messages help your teammates (and future you) understand what changed and why.

Rules:
1. Use imperative mood (like giving a command): "Add flake8 configuration" not "Added flake8" or "flake8 stuff"
2. Reference issue numbers: "Fix store count bug (#47)"
3. One logical change per commit. If you did two things, make two commits.

Good examples:
- `Add flake8 configuration and pre-commit hook (#24)`
- `Fix duplicate store count in household step (#47)`
- `Add type hints to simulation endpoint (#18)`

Bad examples:
- `fixed stuff`
- `updates`
- `WIP`
- `asdfasdf`

> **Beyond this project:** A commit message is a micro-conversation with people you may never meet, who will read it without context. The discipline of writing clearly for an absent audience transfers to emails, documentation, and any situation where your reasoning needs to outlast the conversation.

**Pull request workflow.** Once your code is ready to share:

1. Push your branch: `git push -u origin feature/issue-NUMBER-desc`
2. Open a pull request on GitHub. The PR template asks for: Summary, Changes, Test Plan, Tradeoffs, Checklist.
3. Link to the issue with "Closes #NUMBER" in the PR description.
4. Request a reviewer (another student).
5. Keep PRs small: aim for under ~200 lines of changed code (non-test). Smaller PRs get reviewed faster and have fewer bugs.
6. Respond to review comments, push additional commits to the same branch, and re-request review.
7. Once approved and CI passes, merge to `dev`.

**The daily git rhythm (J-tier checklist):**

```
Starting work:
  git checkout dev
  git pull
  git checkout -b feature/issue-NUMBER-desc   (new branch)
  -- or --
  git checkout feature/my-existing-branch      (resume work)
  git pull                                     (get any updates)

While working:
  git status                    (check where you are)
  git add <specific files>      (stage changes)
  git commit -m "descriptive message (#NUMBER)"

Sharing work:
  git push -u origin <branch>   (first push)
  git push                      (subsequent pushes)
  Open a PR on GitHub when ready for review
```

**S-tier expectations.** S students should be able to: resolve merge conflicts, rebase a feature branch onto an updated `dev` (`git checkout feature/... && git rebase dev`), and help J students recover from git mistakes. If a J student is stuck on git, pair with them until they're unstuck.

#### Edge case brainstorming with LLMs (~10 min)

**Topic: "Using LLMs for edge case brainstorming and test design"**

Demo: Show the "interview first" pattern. Instead of "write tests for this function," show how to describe the function's behavior to the LLM and ask "What edge cases should I test?" Then the student writes the tests. One concrete example; keep it tight.

#### Writing code interactively with an AI tool (~10 min)

**Topic: "The tool is a first draft, not a final answer"**

Starting this week, students write real code. The temptation is to prompt the tool, accept the output, and move on. That's vibe coding, and it produces code that works but that nobody (including you) can maintain. Agentic engineering -- the approach we introduced in Week 1 -- means treating the tool's output as a first draft that you actively shape.

Demo the iterative pattern using a concrete example from the FEAST codebase (e.g., adding a type-hinted helper function):

1. **Start with intent, not instructions.** Describe what you need and why. "I need a function that converts a lat/lon pair to a hexagonal polygon for store markers. It's called from the store creation endpoint. The existing code is in `helpers.py`." The tool proposes something.
2. **Read the output critically.** Does the naming make sense? Are there magic numbers? Is the structure obvious to someone who hasn't seen your prompt? If not, push back: "Rename this parameter to something more descriptive" or "Extract that threshold to a named constant and explain what it represents."
3. **Ask for best practices.** "What's the idiomatic way to handle this in Python/FastAPI?" or "Are there standard patterns for this kind of coordinate transformation?" The tool knows conventions you might not. Use that knowledge, but verify it.
4. **Ask about complexity.** "Is this the simplest way to do this? What could I remove without losing functionality?" Simpler code is almost always better code. If the tool generates a 30-line function, ask whether it could be 15.
5. **Verify readability.** "If someone reads this function six months from now with no context, what would confuse them?" Fix whatever the tool identifies, and fix anything else you notice.

The goal is not to get code faster. The goal is to get code that's **functional, readable, and no more complex than it needs to be**. The tool is a collaborator in achieving that, not a code printer.

**Preview: structured planning.** Many CLI agents have built-in planning features (e.g., Claude Code's `/plan` command) that create a structured plan before making changes. The concept is the same as the iterative pattern above: start with intent, get a plan, review it critically, then execute. We'll use structured planning hands-on in Week 3; for now, just know it exists and that it follows the same "review before accepting" principle.

#### Architecture Decision Records (~5 min)

Show the ADR template from `templates/adr-template.md`. Explain the purpose: when you make a choice that someone else might question later, write a short ADR documenting what you decided and why. This week, the linting student will write one for their configuration choices. By Week 4, everyone will have written at least one.

Quick example: "We chose to ignore E501 (line length) because the project convention allows long lines. Alternative: enforce 120-char limit. We rejected this because the existing codebase has many long lines and reformatting them all would create noisy diffs during onboarding."

#### Review Week 1 project context files (~5 min)

Quick group check-in: each student shows their project context file from last week's solo work. Are they capturing useful information? Is anything missing? This takes 1-2 minutes per student and reinforces the habit of maintaining the artifact.

### Assigned Work

The following issues map directly to the backlog. Pair J students with S students where possible.

#### Issue #24: Incorporate linting (1 student, J or S)

[SCAFFOLD: Linting Setup Guide]
```
Priority order: Get CI running first so everyone else's PRs benefit.

1. Add flake8 to dev dependencies in pyproject.toml
2. Create a .flake8 config file:
   - Ignore E501 (line length - per project convention)
   - Set max-complexity to 10
3. Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs flake8 on PRs.
   THIS IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY. Once this exists, every PR
   from every student gets automated linting checks. Ship this
   as its own PR before moving to step 4.
4. Run flake8 on the codebase. You'll get hundreds of errors.
   DON'T fix them all. Instead:
   - Fix only the files you can handle in ~45 min
   - Create a .flake8 exclude list for files you didn't touch
   - The goal is to get CI green, not to fix everything
5. Add eslint check for the frontend (it already has eslint.config.js)
6. Write a short ADR (using templates/adr-template.md) documenting
   your linting configuration choices: which rules you enforced,
   which you excluded, and why. Put it in docs/decisions/ in the
   FEAST repo. This is your first Architecture Decision Record.

LLM usage: Ask the LLM to explain what each flake8 error code means
   if you encounter one you don't recognize. Don't ask it to fix the code.
```

#### Issues #18, #19, #20: Add Docstrings and Type Hints (2-3 students, mix of J and S)

Split by module. Each student takes one area:

| Student | Module | Files | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| J student | ABM files | `household.py`, `store.py`, `geo_model.py` | #18 |
| J student | API files | `routes.py`, `helpers.py`, `api_server.py` | #19 |
| S student | Preprocessing | `get_data.py`, `household_constants.py` | #20 |

[SCAFFOLD: Type Hints Guide]
```
For each function in your assigned files:
1. Read the function. Understand what it takes and returns.
2. Add parameter type hints and return type hints.
3. For complex types, use modern Python syntax:
   - list[dict] not List[Dict]
   - str | None not Optional[str]
   - Use TypedDict for dict structures with known keys
4. Add a one-line docstring if the function name isn't self-explanatory.
   Skip docstrings for obvious functions like getters.

Example before:
   def has_resources(self):
       if self.income < 10000:
           return False

Example after:
   def has_resources(self) -> bool:
       if self.income < 10000:
           return False

LLM usage: You can ask the LLM "What type does this function return?"
   if it's unclear from the code. Verify its answer by reading the callers.
   Do NOT ask the LLM to add all the type hints for you.
```

#### First tests: `household.py` pure functions (1 S student)

[SCAFFOLD: Testing Guide]
```
1. Set up pytest:
   - Add pytest and pytest-asyncio to pyproject.toml dev dependencies
   - Create tests/ directory with __init__.py and conftest.py
2. Write tests for these pure functions in household.py:

   has_resources() (line 169):
   - Test: income < 10000 returns False regardless of household size
   - Test: household_size >= 2 and income < 15000 returns False
   - Test: household_size >= 3 and income < 25000 returns False
   - Test: income = 25001, household_size = 3 returns True
   - Edge: exact boundary values (10000, 15000, 25000)

   get_monthly_trip_count() (line 178):
   - Test all 3 paths: resources+vehicles=7, resources+no_vehicles=8, no_resources=6

   get_color() (line 57):
   - Test: mfai=40 should produce pure red
   - Test: mfai=70 should produce green-ish
   - Test: mfai=100 should produce green
   - Test: boundary at normalized=0.5

3. Run tests: uv run pytest tests/ -v
4. Run mutation testing: uv run mutmut run --paths-to-mutate=food_access_model/abm/household.py

LLM usage: After writing your tests, ask the LLM:
   "I wrote tests for a function that classifies household resource
   access based on income and household size thresholds.
   What edge cases might I be missing?"
   Then add any good suggestions as additional test cases.
```

### Deliverable
Each student opens a PR for their assigned work. Every PR must pass CI (once the linting student ships the GitHub Actions workflow) and receive one peer review before merge. Reviews happen asynchronously during the week, not deferred to Week 3. The linting student's CI workflow PR is the highest priority and should be reviewed and merged first so it applies to everyone else's PRs.

### Solo Work (later in the week)

**Apply the pattern you just learned to new territory.**

You now know how to add type hints, write tests, or set up linting. Apply that same skill to parts of the codebase beyond your assigned files.

| If your assigned work was... | Your solo hunting ground is... |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Type hints (#18 ABM files) | Add type hints to `repository/db_repository.py`, `model_multi_processing/batch_running.py` |
| Type hints (#19 API files) | Add type hints to `api/helpers.py`, clean up the duplicate entry points (`api_server.py`, `server.py`) |
| Type hints (#20 preprocessing) | Add type hints to root-level `constants.py`, `parallel_scheduler.py`, `insert_stores.py` |
| Linting (#24) | Fix flake8 warnings in files you excluded in your first pass |
| Tests (household.py) | Write tests for `Store` class, `convert_centroid_to_polygon` in `api/helpers.py` |

**File issues for anything you can't fix in this session** but that you notice along the way. Keep building the backlog.

**LLM usage**: Same rules as the group session. You can ask the LLM to explain unfamiliar code or brainstorm edge cases for tests, but write the code yourself.

### Roadmap Activity
At the start of week 3's group session, spend 10 minutes as a team:
- Review the project board. Are the priorities still right?
- Did anyone's solo work surface issues that change the priorities?
- Assign week 3's issues based on what each student has learned so far.

---

## Week 3: Bug Fixes and Code Quality

### Group Session (40 min)
**Topic: "Specs before code, and completing the review pipeline"**

#### Adding the third review layer: LLM adversarial review (~15 min)

The team has been using two review layers since Week 2 (automated CI + human peer review). This week adds the third: LLM adversarial review.

Demo: Take a recent PR and run it through your CLI agent in a fresh session with a skeptical reviewer prompt. Walk through the output. Show how to evaluate valid vs. false positive criticisms. Show the prompt that works well (e.g., "Review this diff for correctness, performance, and maintainability issues. Be thorough and skeptical. For each finding, rate your confidence and explain why it matters.").

**The rotation:** Each PR gets a designated adversarial reviewer (not the author, not the peer reviewer). The adversarial reviewer opens a fresh LLM session (no prior context about the PR), feeds it the diff, and posts findings as PR comments, marking each as "Valid" or "False positive (because...)". Assign the rotation at the start of each week so everyone knows their review responsibilities.

Every PR from here on gets all three layers: (1) CI checks (automated), (2) human peer review, (3) LLM adversarial review by a different student.

#### Specs before code (~15 min)

Demo the "spec first" pattern: before implementing, write a short specification in the issue comment describing what you'll change, why, and how you'll verify it worked. For design decisions (choosing between approaches, changing behavior), write this as a short ADR using the template. For straightforward fixes, a paragraph in the issue comment is sufficient.

> **Beyond this project:** The spec-first habit separates junior from senior professionals in any field. Writing down what you plan to do before doing it protects you from building the wrong thing, gives others a chance to catch problems early, and creates a record of your reasoning.

Show an example: the optimization student (#74) should write an ADR; the bug fix student (#47) should write a diagnosis paragraph.

##### Using structured planning tools

After showing hand-written specs, demo your CLI agent's planning capability. (In Claude Code this is the `/plan` command; other agents have similar features, or you can simply prompt the agent to "create a plan before making changes.") Take one of this week's assigned issues (e.g., #74 optimization) and show the workflow:

1. **Ask the agent to plan** what you want to accomplish: "I want to optimize the household step function to iterate over stores once instead of four times. The relevant code is in `food_access_model/abm/household.py`. Create a plan before making any changes."
2. **The agent explores the codebase** and produces a structured plan: which files to change, in what order, what tests to write, how to verify the refactor didn't change behavior.
3. **Review the plan critically.** Same rules as reviewing generated code. Does it make sense? Did it miss anything? Is it over-scoped? Did it identify files or dependencies you wouldn't have thought of?
4. **Compare to a hand-written spec** for the same issue. What's different? (The tool usually maps file-level specifics better; the human usually captures intent and constraints better.)

Key teaching point: structured planning is most useful for **single-feature implementations** where you know what you want but need to map the code changes. It is not a substitute for thinking about *whether* to do something (that's the ADR). It's a tool for mapping *how* after you've decided *what*.

Best workflow: write your hand-written spec first (the *what* and *why*), then feed it to your agent's planning feature as context to get the *how*. You get your reasoning about intent and the tool's mapping of implementation details.

##### Connecting the dots: you are doing engineering (~2 min)

Pause and take stock. Over the past three weeks, you have: filed issues (problem decomposition), reviewed code (evaluating quality), written ADRs (documenting decisions), built a review pipeline (designing quality gates), and now written specs before code (planning). None of these are "coding." All of them are engineering.

Remember the focus shift from Week 1: when agents handle syntax and boilerplate, the developer's job shifts to these higher-level skills. You have been doing exactly that. The agent loop (observe, think, act) handles implementation mechanics. Your job is deciding what to build, why, and how to verify it works. That split is agentic engineering, and you have been practicing it since Week 1, even when you did not have a name for it yet.

### Assigned Work

#### Issue #47: Check 'Stores within 1 Mile' logic (1 student, S)

This is a reported bug: after running a simulation step, all houses appear to have the same number of stores within 1 mile.

[SCAFFOLD: Bug Investigation Guide]
```
1. UNDERSTAND before you fix. Read food_access_model/abm/household.py:131
   (stores_with_1_miles).
   - It iterates self.model.stores_list
   - It reads self.distances_map[store.unique_id]
   - It counts stores where distance <= 1.0

2. Hypothesis: When is distances_map populated?
   - Look at calculate_distances() (line 246)
   - It's called in step() (line 259) only if distances_map is None
   - After step 0, distances_map is never recalculated even if stores change

3. Write a test that reproduces the bug BEFORE fixing it:
   - Create a Household with a known distances_map
   - Call stores_with_1_miles()
   - Verify the count matches expected

4. Now investigate: Does distances_map need to be recalculated
   when stores are added or removed between steps?

5. Before implementing, write a diagnosis in the issue comment:
   what's broken, what causes it, and how you'll fix it. This
   documents your reasoning for future readers and gives the
   team a chance to catch flawed assumptions before you code.

6. Write the fix. The test should now pass.

LLM usage: Describe the bug and your hypothesis to the LLM.
   Ask "What else could cause all households to report the
   same store count?" See if it suggests causes you missed.

LLM planning: After writing your diagnosis, ask your CLI agent to
   create a plan before implementing. Compare its plan to yours.
   Did it identify files or dependencies you missed? Did it
   over-scope the change? Use the plan as a cross-check, not a
   replacement for your own thinking.
```

#### Issue #74: Optimize step function (1 student, S)

The step function iterates all stores multiple times per household: once in `calculate_distances()`, once in `get_closest_cspm()`, once in `get_closest_spm()`, once in `stores_with_1_miles()`.

[SCAFFOLD: Optimization Guide]
```
1. Read household.py step() and all the functions it calls.
   Count: how many times does each household iterate over all stores?
   Answer: at least 4 times (calculate_distances, get_closest_cspm,
   get_closest_spm, stores_with_1_miles).

2. Write this spec as a short ADR (using templates/adr-template.md)
   before coding. It should cover: current behavior, proposed change,
   alternatives considered, and performance implications. Example:
   "I propose consolidating into a single pass that computes:
   - distances_map (all store distances)
   - closest_spm and closest_cspm (by filtering distances_map)
   - stores_within_1_mile count (from distances_map)
   This reduces O(4*S) to O(S) per household where S = store count.
   Alternative: keep separate functions but cache intermediate results.
   Rejected because a single pass is simpler and equally performant."
   Post it in the issue comment for team review BEFORE coding.

3. Write tests for the CURRENT behavior first (so you can verify
   your refactor doesn't change results).

4. Implement the optimization.

5. Verify tests still pass with identical results.

LLM usage: After writing your spec, ask the LLM to interview you:
   "I want to optimize a function that iterates stores 4 times per
   household. Ask me questions about my approach."
   The LLM should push back on edge cases you might miss.

LLM planning: After your spec is reviewed, ask your CLI agent to
   plan the refactor before implementing. This is particularly useful
   here because a single-pass optimization touches multiple
   functions and the plan will identify all the call sites.
   Compare its plan to your ADR. Did it find dependencies you
   missed? Did it suggest a different decomposition?
```

#### Issue #27: Clean up redundant functions (1 student, J+S pair)

[SCAFFOLD: Redundancy Audit]
```
1. Map out every function that accesses households or stores:
   - repository/db_repository.py: get_households(), get_food_stores()
     (sync psycopg2 singleton, initialized via async initialize())
   - abm/geo_model.py: reads from model parameters passed at construction
   - api/routes.py: direct asyncpg queries using the global connection pool

2. For each, document: What does it return? Who calls it?
   Is it actually used? Also check the three entry points
   (api_server.py, server.py, food_access_model/main.py) for
   overlap.

3. Write an ADR: "Which data access pattern should we standardize on?"
   db_repository.py uses psycopg2 (sync) as a singleton.
   routes.py uses asyncpg (async) with a connection pool.
   Both query the same database. Which should we keep? Why?
   (Consider: FastAPI is async-native, so async is preferred.)

4. Remove the functions that are unused or redundant.
   Consolidate entry points if the team agrees.
   Make sure nothing breaks.

LLM usage: Ask the LLM to help you trace callers:
   "Where is get_households() from db_repository.py called?"
   Verify by grepping the codebase yourself.
```

#### Issue #50: Improve logging (1 student, J)

[SCAFFOLD: Logging Guide]
```
1. Read the current logging across the codebase. Note:
   - routes.py uses logging.info and logging.error
   - api_server.py and geo_model.py use print() with flush=True
   - server.py sets up its own custom logger with file + stream handlers
   - food_access_model/main.py has minimal logging setup
   - No consistent format across files, no shared logging config

2. Create a logging configuration:
   - Add LOG_LEVEL env var (default: INFO)
   - Use structured format: timestamp, level, module, message
   - Replace all print() statements with appropriate logging calls

3. Guidelines to follow:
   - logging.info: service start/stop, simulation step completed,
     instance created/deleted
   - logging.debug: query details, timing, intermediate values
   - logging.error: exceptions, failed operations
   - NEVER log: passwords, API keys, full SQL with user data

LLM usage: Ask the LLM "What are best practices for structured
   logging in a FastAPI application?" Use the answer as a reference,
   but implement it yourself.
```

### Review Protocol (full pipeline, completing what started in Week 2)
For each PR:
1. CI checks must pass (automated, set up in Week 2)
2. Author writes PR with summary, test plan, tradeoffs
3. One peer does human review (continuing from Week 2)
4. A different student runs adversarial LLM review per the rotation and posts findings as PR comments, marking each as "Valid" or "False positive (because...)" (new this week)

### Solo Work (later in the week)

**Pick an issue from the backlog and work it yourself.**

By now the team has a mix of pre-existing issues and student-filed issues from weeks 1-2. This is the first week students choose their own work.

[SCAFFOLD: Self-Directed Work Guide]
```
1. Go to the GitHub project board.
2. Pick an issue that:
   - Is labeled "should-fix" or "nice-to-have"
   - Matches your comfort level
   - Isn't already claimed by someone else
3. Comment on the issue: "I'm picking this up."
4. Before coding, write a one-paragraph plan in the issue comment:
   what you'll change, what files you'll touch, how you'll test it.
5. Implement it. Open a PR.

If you finish early, pick another one or extend your work.
If you get stuck, file a comment describing where you're stuck
and move on. Someone else (or you next week) can pick it up.

Good candidates for solo work this week:
- Any remaining flake8 fixes from #24
- print() -> logging conversions (related to #50)
- Documenting magic numbers in household.py
- Small issues you filed in week 1
```

**LLM usage unlock**: You can now use the LLM to help you write a spec for your chosen issue (use the "interview first" pattern from the group session). You can also use it for adversarial review of your own PR in a fresh session before requesting peer review.

When working with the tool on spec writing or code review, use the iterative pattern from Week 2: don't accept the first output. Push back on complexity, ask about best practices, and verify that the result is readable to someone with no context. For specs specifically, a good workflow is: (1) describe the problem to the tool, (2) ask it to interview you about your proposed approach, (3) use its questions to strengthen the spec, (4) ask "what's the simplest version of this that solves the problem?" before finalizing.

### Roadmap Activity
Before the week 4 session, each student comments on 1-2 issues they think should be prioritized for weeks 4-5, with a sentence explaining why. The group reviews these nominations at the top of the week 4 session and adjusts assignments.

---

## Week 4: Core Algorithm and Data Improvements

### Group Session (40 min)
**Topic: "Project management artifacts: manual vs. auto-generated"**

Students have been writing ADRs by hand since Week 2. This session goes deeper into project management artifacts and introduces LLM-assisted generation.

#### Manual vs. auto-generated ADRs (~15 min)

Demo: Take issue #91 (multiple stores for scoring) as the example. First, show a hand-written ADR for it (or write one live). Then, show your CLI agent generating an ADR from the issue description and relevant diff. Compare the two:
- What did the auto-generated version get right?
- What did it miss? (Usually: the reasoning behind rejected alternatives, unstated constraints, stakeholder concerns)
- When is each approach appropriate?

**Guidelines for the team going forward:**
- Auto-generated ADRs are good starting drafts. Feed the tool the diff, the PR description, and the issue context. Review and edit the output.
- Manual ADRs are essential when the reasoning matters more than the facts: design tradeoffs, stakeholder constraints, "why not" decisions.
- The "explain every line" rule applies to prose too. If you can't explain why your ADR says what it says, rewrite it.

#### Roadmaps as living artifacts (~10 min)

Show FEAST_edu's ROADMAP.md as an example. Discuss how it stays useful:
- Updated after each milestone, not written once and forgotten
- Tracks dependencies between milestones
- Identifies the critical path to the next deliverable

Demo: Show your CLI agent generating a roadmap summary from `git log`. Compare to the manually maintained ROADMAP.md. What's lost when you auto-generate? (Priorities, dependencies, judgment about what matters, forward-looking decisions.) Auto-generated changelogs are useful artifacts, but they're not roadmaps.

#### Planning at different scales (~10 min)

In Week 3, you used your agent's planning capability for a single feature. That's the fine-grained use case: "I know what I'm building, help me map the code changes." This week introduces planning at a larger scope.

**Multi-issue planning.** Demo: take the reporting feature cluster (#94 + #79 + frontend #36). These three issues are interdependent: the backend needs an API (#94) that serves metrics (#79) that the frontend displays (#36). Ask your agent to plan across all three, identifying the dependency chain (backend API contract must exist before frontend can consume it) and proposing an implementation order. (In Claude Code, `/ultraplan` is designed for this; with other tools, provide the full set of issues as context and ask for a sequenced plan.)

Compare to the team's manually maintained roadmap:
- What does the agent-generated plan capture that the manual roadmap doesn't? (Usually: file-level specifics, dependency ordering, implementation sequencing.)
- What does the manual roadmap capture that the plan doesn't? (Usually: priorities, stakeholder context, what *not* to build, judgment about what matters.)

**Comprehensive review.** Like the adversarial review rotation from Week 3, but broader: reviewing an entire branch's accumulated changes rather than a single PR's diff. This catches cross-cutting issues that per-PR reviews miss. (In Claude Code, `/ultrareview` does this; with other tools, feed the full branch diff and ask for a thorough review.) We'll use this more in Week 5.

**When to use each:**

| Approach | Scope | Input | Good for |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Single-feature planning | One feature | Issue description + codebase | Mapping code changes for one task |
| Multi-issue planning | Project phase | Set of issues + codebase | Sequencing work, finding dependencies |
| Branch-level review | Branch or PR set | Diff against base branch | Comprehensive review before merge |
| Hand-written spec/ADR | Any | Your reasoning | Capturing *why* and *what*, not just *how* |

No planning tool replaces the human judgment of *which* goals matter. That's the roadmap and ADR layer. The tools map *how*; you decide *what* and *why*.

##### Recognizing agentic design patterns (~5 min)

At this point in the curriculum, you have been practicing several agentic design patterns without naming them. Now that you have hands-on experience, it is worth naming them:

- **Reflection:** The adversarial review rotation (Week 3). A reviewer opens a fresh agent session that critiques code it did not produce. One agent evaluates another's output.
- **Planning:** You have been using structured planning since Week 3 and multi-issue planning this week. The agent explores the codebase and produces a structured plan before writing code.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Every workflow in this curriculum has you reviewing, approving, or redirecting agent output. The agent never ships code autonomously. This is the pattern that separates agentic engineering from vibe coding.
- **Tool use:** Every time the agent reads a file, runs tests, or checks git, it is using tools provided by the harness. This is what makes agents different from chatbots: they can verify their own answers.
- **Evaluation:** The three-layer review pipeline (CI + human peer review + LLM adversarial review) is an evaluation pattern. Multiple evaluators with different perspectives check the same output.

These are not just "things we do." They are recognized design patterns in agentic systems. Understanding them gives you a framework for evaluating new tools: when someone shows you a new AI development tool, ask "what patterns does it use?" If it has no human-in-the-loop, no planning step, and no reflection, it is optimized for speed, not quality.

For the full set of patterns and deeper definitions, see [Guide 12: Agentic Engineering Concepts](docs/guides/12-agentic-engineering-concepts).

#### Project context file check-in (~5 min)

Quick round: each student opens their project context file. Has it been updated since Week 1? Does it reflect what you've learned about the codebase? Take 2-3 minutes to update it now. This is a maintenance habit, not a one-time task.

### Assigned Work

#### Issue #91: Calculate food access scores using multiple stores (1-2 students, S)

This is the highest-impact algorithmic change in the backlog.

[SCAFFOLD: Algorithm Change Guide]
```
1. READ THE PAPER FIRST. Understand the MFAI methodology from
   Koh et al. 2019. The current implementation in
   food_access_model/abm/household.py:218 (get_mfai) only considers
   the single closest SPM and CSPM. Note: the bc_pantries branch
   extends this with pantry support for low-income households.

2. Write an ADR answering:
   - How many stores should we consider? Top 3? All within X miles?
   - How do we weight distance? Linear decay? Inverse square?
   - What does the paper say vs. what makes practical sense?
   - Performance impact: if we consider all stores, what's the
     complexity change for 50k households x 200 stores?

3. Get the ADR reviewed (post as a PR or issue comment) BEFORE coding.

4. Write tests for the CURRENT get_mfai() behavior first.

5. Implement the new algorithm. Tests for new behavior should be
   written alongside (not after).

6. Compare results: run both old and new on the same data.
   Document the difference in scores.

LLM usage: Use the LLM to discuss algorithm tradeoffs:
   "The current MFAI considers only the closest store. I'm considering
   [your approach]. What are the tradeoffs?" This is a legitimate
   design discussion where the LLM adds value.
```

#### Issue #67: Refactor spatial data handling (1 student, S)

[SCAFFOLD: Spatial Refactor Guide]
```
1. Understand the current flow:
   - Household data stored as EPSG:4326 (lat/lon WKT in centroid_wkt)
   - Store data stored as EPSG:3857 (polygon WKT in geometry column)
   - This CRS inconsistency means different coordinate handling per table
   - Backend (api/helpers.py:29) generates polygons when adding stores:
     hexagons (50m radius) for supermarkets, triangles (25m) for convenience
   - Frontend (MapComponent.js) uses proj4 to reproject store coords
   - The bc_pantries branch takes a different approach: stores take
     lat/lon and convert internally, households reproject internally

2. The issue says: store and deliver all data in 4326. Only use 3857
   for internal distance calculations. Stop generating polygons
   (frontend uses marker icons, not polygon shapes).

3. This touches multiple files. Plan the changes before coding:
   - preprocessing/get_data.py: stop polygon generation at data load time
   - api/helpers.py: stop polygon generation when adding stores via API
   - abm/store.py, abm/household.py: keep internal 3857 for distance math
   - api/routes.py: return 4326 coordinates in query results
   - Frontend MapComponent.js: remove proj4 reprojection
   - insert_stores.py: update to match new storage format

4. This is a cross-cutting change. Open it as a draft PR early
   and coordinate with whoever is working on frontend.

LLM usage: Ask the LLM to explain the difference between EPSG:4326
   and EPSG:3857, and when you'd use each. This is the kind of
   domain knowledge question where LLMs are genuinely helpful.
```

#### Issue #94: Reporting API + Issue #79: Show metrics + Frontend #36: Reporting View (2-3 students, J+S pair)

These issues are related: the backend needs a reporting API (#94), the backend needs to serve richer metrics (#79), and the frontend needs a view to display them (frontend #36).

[SCAFFOLD: Feature Development Guide]
```
Backend student (S or J/S):
1. Write a spec: What metrics should the reporting API return?
   Look at what get_household_stats already returns (routes.py:463).
   What's missing? Suggestions:
   - Score distribution (histogram buckets)
   - Scores by income bracket
   - Scores by vehicle ownership
   - Change between simulation steps
2. Design the API endpoint(s). Write the route signature and
   response model (Pydantic) before implementing the query.
3. Write tests for the new endpoint.
4. Implement.

Frontend student (J):
1. Wait for the API spec from the backend student.
2. Design a simple metrics panel (can be a sidebar or modal).
   The frontend already has a DataComponent.jsx that shows basic
   stats (household count, store counts, avg income/vehicles).
   You can extend it or build a new component.
3. Fetch from the new API endpoint via the Axios client in
   src/shared/client.js.
4. Display using basic charts or formatted tables.
   (Don't add a charting library unless needed. The app already
   mixes Bootstrap and Tailwind, so pick one and be consistent.)

LLM usage: Both students can use the LLM to brainstorm what
   metrics would be useful. The backend student can ask for help
   designing the SQL aggregation queries. The frontend student
   can ask for help with React component structure.
   Both must understand and be able to explain their code.

Planning across the feature: Before splitting up work, ask
   your CLI agent to plan the full feature across backend API,
   metrics calculation, and frontend display. This helps
   identify the API contract both students need to agree on.
   The backend student should define the API spec first; the
   agent's planning output can help map the endpoint design
   and response model.
```

### Solo Work (later in the week)

**Continue self-directed work, but now with design authority.**

By week 4, students should be proposing issues, not just picking from the existing list. The assignment this week:

1. **File at least 1 new issue** based on something you discovered while working on your assigned task. These can be bugs, enhancements, or refactoring opportunities.
2. **Pick and work 1 issue from the backlog** (student-filed or original). Follow the full cycle: claim it, write a plan, implement, test, PR.

**For S students**: If you see a pattern (e.g., "there are 5 places where store type classification is hardcoded"), file a single issue that captures the systemic problem, not 5 individual ones. Propose a solution in the issue body. This is how you move from "contributor" to "maintainer."

**For J students**: Pair up with an S student on their assigned work if your solo issue feels too big. Or pick a small issue: a documentation gap, a missing type hint in a file nobody's touched yet, a test for an untested function.

**LLM usage**: Full design discussion. You can use the LLM to brainstorm solutions, discuss tradeoffs, and generate small code blocks against a spec you wrote. You must still explain every line in your PR.

### Roadmap Activity
At the week 5 session, spend 15 minutes on roadmap planning:
- What's realistic to finish in weeks 5-6?
- What should be documented and deferred?
- Each student commits to one thing they'll ship before the end.

---

## Week 5: Integration and Polish

### Group Session (45 min)
**Topic: "Security review, deployment readiness, and process retrospective"**

#### Security review demo (~15 min)

Demo: Run an adversarial security review using your CLI agent on the current codebase. Show the real issues it finds (raw SQL patterns, hardcoded CORS, no input validation, global mutable state). Discuss which are real risks vs. theoretical.

#### Deployment configuration audit (~10 min)

Revisit the deployment topology from Week 1. As a group exercise:

1. **Map the current topology.** Where is the staging instance running? What backend does it talk to? What database? How are those configured? Have students trace the actual configuration values, not guess.
2. **Verify local setups.** Each student checks their own three configuration levers (client.js baseURL, .env DB_HOST, CORS origins). Are all three layers pointing where they expect? Anyone accidentally pointing at staging?
3. **Discuss new environment deployment.** What would need to change to deploy to a new environment? Walk through the list: new DB credentials, new CORS origins, new client.js baseURL (or the env var if frontend #10 was completed), Docker configuration, DNS.
4. **Connect to security.** The security hardening scaffold already mentions CORS consolidation and env vars. This exercise makes those abstract items concrete. A misconfigured deployment is a security issue.

This exercise should take 10 minutes and reinforces the mental model from Week 1 with 5 weeks of hands-on experience.

#### Review pipeline retrospective (~15 min)

The full three-layer review pipeline has been running since Week 3. Take stock as a group:
- **CI checks:** What's it catching? Are there false positives or noisy checks that should be tuned? Should we add more checks (type checking, test suite)?
- **Human peer review:** What's working? What patterns do reviewers keep flagging? Are reviews happening promptly or becoming a bottleneck?
- **LLM adversarial review:** What's it catching that humans miss? What are the most common false positives? Is the rotation working, or should we adjust?

Adjust the process based on what the team has learned. This is an explicit process improvement step, not just a chat.

**Try a branch-level review:** If the team hasn't done one yet, feed the full branch diff (the accumulated changes since branching from main) to your CLI agent and ask for a comprehensive review. (In Claude Code, `/ultrareview` does this automatically.) Compare its findings to the per-PR adversarial review comments from Weeks 3-5. Is it catching cross-cutting issues that per-PR reviews missed? Is it generating noise? Discuss whether branch-level review should be part of the pre-merge checklist for the next cohort, and if so, at what cadence (per PR, per milestone, before merge to main).

#### The complete agentic workflow (~10 min)

Over the past four weeks, you have practiced every piece of a disciplined agentic workflow: iterative code shaping (Week 2), specs before code (Week 3), phased planning at different scales (Weeks 3-4), review at multiple layers (Weeks 2-3), and decision documentation (Weeks 2-4). This section assembles those pieces into a single, repeatable process you can use for any task from this point forward.

**The core loop: Spec, Plan, Execute, Verify**

1. **Spec** (you write). Before touching the agent, write 2-3 sentences: what are you changing, why, and how will you know it worked? This is your engineering judgment. The agent does not decide what to build.
2. **Plan** (agent + you). Ask the agent to create a phased plan based on your spec. Each phase must leave the codebase in a working, testable state. Review the plan before any code is written.
3. **Execute** (agent, one phase at a time). Implement one phase. Do not batch phases.
4. **Verify** (you, after each phase). Four checks:
   - Run the full test suite (not just the file you changed)
   - Review the diff line by line (the "explain every line" rule applies here)
   - Check for unnecessary complexity (did the agent over-engineer?)
   - Update the plan if what you learned changes the approach
5. **Document** (you, when needed). Write an ADR if a phase involved choosing between approaches. Not every phase needs one.
6. **Repeat** until all phases are verified. Then do a final branch-level review and open the PR.

Walk through a concrete example: take the security hardening task (or whichever assigned issue the student is working on). Trace it through the loop: the spec is "add input validation to the simulation parameters endpoint to prevent injection and malformed data," the plan breaks into phases (identify endpoints, add validation, add tests, update docs), each phase gets verified independently.

**Key teaching points:**

The loop is **adaptive**. You update the plan after each phase based on what you learned. A plan that never changes is a sign you are not paying attention, not a sign of good planning.

Verification is after **every phase**, not just at the end. Deferred verification is how wrong approaches compound into expensive rework.

The "explain every line" rule is the checkpoint that prevents vibe coding from sneaking in during execution. Tests can pass even when the code is over-engineered, poorly named, or doing something you did not intend. The diff review catches what tests cannot.

You can encode workflow rules in your project context file to make the process automatic. A workflow section in your CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md tells the agent to follow phased execution, run tests after each phase, and flag complexity. See Guide 13 for an example.

**Matching workflow to task size:**

| Task scope | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| Quick fix (< 30 min) | Spec (1 sentence) -> implement -> verify. No phasing needed. |
| Single feature (1-4 hours) | Full spec-plan-execute-verify loop with phases |
| Cross-cutting (multi-issue) | Same loop, add multi-issue planning to sequence work |
| Exploratory (unknown scope) | Investigation phase first (read code, form hypothesis), then spec |

The judgment of which workflow fits which task is itself an engineering skill. When in doubt, default to phased execution. The overhead is small; the safety margin is large.

For the full reference, including the verification checkpoint in detail, common failure modes, context file encoding, and a printable checklist, see [Guide 13: Agentic Workflow Best Practices](docs/guides/13-agentic-workflow-best-practices).

#### Project context file and artifact audit (~5 min)

Each student reviews their project context file and commits any updates. Also review: are the ADRs you've written still accurate? Has any decision been superseded by later work? This maintenance habit matters more than the initial writing.

### Assigned Work

#### Security hardening (1 student, any level)

[SCAFFOLD: Security Checklist]
```
Run through this checklist. Fix what you can; file issues for the rest.

[ ] Input validation: Add Pydantic models for all POST/DELETE endpoints
    that accept user input (routes.py:191, 308, 352)
[ ] CORS: Consolidate entry points and make CORS origins configurable
    via env var. Currently food_access_model/main.py hardcodes two
    origins; api_server.py hardcodes a different one.
[ ] SQL: Audit all raw SQL for injection risks. Both routes.py (asyncpg)
    and db_repository.py (psycopg2) execute queries. Check for
    string concatenation in query construction.
[ ] Rate limiting: The advance endpoint (routes.py:155) triggers
    expensive multiprocessing computation. Should it have rate limiting?
    What happens if two advance requests run concurrently?
[ ] Env vars: Verify .env.example is complete and .env is in .gitignore
[ ] Auth: There is currently zero authentication on any endpoint.
    Document whether this is acceptable for the deployment context.
[ ] Deployment configuration: Verify each layer's configuration
    points are documented and environment-appropriate. No local
    .env files should contain staging/production credentials.
    client.js baseURL should not point at production in dev branches.

Use the LLM adversarial review to scan for issues you missed:
   "Review this file for OWASP Top 10 security risks. Be thorough."
   Then evaluate each finding yourself.
```

#### Remaining issues and PR cleanup (all students)

- Merge all open PRs from weeks 2-4
- Resolve any review feedback
- Fix CI if anything is broken
- Clean up stale branches (the repo has 30+)

#### Issue #63: Unit conversion consistency (1 student, J or S)

```
Audit all distance calculations in the codebase.
- household.py: calculate_distances() (line 246) computes distances
  using self.model.space.distance() which returns meters (EPSG:3857)
- household.py: stores_with_1_miles() (line 131) compares to 1.0 (miles)
- household.py: get_closest_cspm/spm return distances in... what unit?
  Are they consistently miles or meters?
- constants.py: SEARCHRADIUS = 500 (in what unit? meters? miles?)
- household_constants.py: center point and radius (15km) for county bounds
- api/helpers.py: polygon generation uses meters (50m, 25m, 20m)
- The bc_pantries branch uses direct Euclidean distance from centroid
  coordinates instead of Mesa's GeoSpace.distance()

Document every conversion and verify consistency.
Write tests that assert expected distances for known coordinates.
Pay special attention to the CRS inconsistency: households are 4326
(degrees), stores are 3857 (meters). Distance math on mixed CRS
will produce garbage.
```

### Solo Work (later in the week)

**Full autonomy. Pick what matters most and ship it.**

By week 5, students have the full toolkit: reading code, writing specs, testing, adversarial review, issue filing. Solo work is now indistinguishable from "being a developer on this project."

Each student should:
1. Look at the project board. What's the highest-impact thing you can finish this week?
2. If nothing on the board excites you, scan the codebase for something that bugs you and file+fix it.
3. Ship a PR with the full protocol (spec, tests, adversarial self-review in a fresh session).

**Some high-value targets if students need direction:**
- Write tests for API endpoints (routes.py) using FastAPI TestClient
- Add missing validation to POST endpoints
- Improve error messages for common failure modes
- Frontend: add loading states, error handling for API failures,
  replace window-object state with proper React state management
- Frontend #10: Move the API base URL from hardcoded client.js to
  an environment variable (VITE_API_URL)
- Frontend #36: Build the reporting/metrics view
- Start a benchmarking script for #51 (simulation runtime) as a handoff artifact
- Consolidate the three backend entry points into one

### Roadmap Activity
Final prioritization before week 6. Each student reviews the full issue list and tags 2-3 issues as "recommended for next cohort" with a sentence about why and what context the next team would need.

---

## Week 6: Retrospective and Handoff

### Group Session (60 min)
**Topic: Retrospective + demo + knowledge transfer**

1. **Demo** (20 min): Each student demos one thing they shipped.
2. **Retro** (20 min): What worked? What didn't? Specifically:
   - Which agentic tool patterns were most helpful? (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
   - Where did AI tools lead you astray? What did you learn to watch for?
   - How did the review pipeline (CI + human + LLM adversarial) affect code quality?
   - Were the project management artifacts (context files, ADRs, roadmaps) worth the effort? Which would you keep, drop, or change?
   - Agentic engineering vs. vibe coding: when did you catch yourself slipping into vibe coding? What pulled you back? Did the progressive restrictions help or just slow you down?
   - How did agent planning tools compare to hand-written specs and manual review? When was each more useful?
   - What would you tell the next cohort?
3. **Handoff** (20 min): Finalize the roadmap for the next cohort.

### Assigned Work

#### Everyone: Update documentation
- Each student updates the README section for the area they worked on
- Ensure all new environment variables are in `.env.example`

#### Roadmap handoff document

This is the team's final output beyond the code itself. Write a `docs/ROADMAP.md` that includes:

1. **What we shipped** (with PR links): A summary of every merged improvement.
2. **What we started but didn't finish** (with issue links and status): Draft PRs, partial implementations, open questions.
3. **What the next cohort should tackle**, organized by priority:

| Priority | Issue | Context the Next Team Needs |
|----------|-------|---------------------------|
| High | #42: New location initialization | Census API integration, parameterize preprocessing for arbitrary counties. Currently hardcoded to Brown County (FIPS 55009). |
| High | #44: Schema migration (start_step/end_step) | Touches every query in routes.py. Need migration script + #45 query updates. |
| High | #67: Spatial data handling refactor | CRS inconsistency (households 4326, stores 3857) causes confusion. bc_pantries branch has a partial approach. |
| Medium | #43: Census block aggregation layer | Requires PostGIS, frontend map layer. Depends on #67 finishing. |
| Medium | #51: Simulation runtime improvements | Architecture-level. Benchmarking suite needed first. Multiprocessing helps but may not scale to very large counties. |
| Medium | #91: Multi-store MFAI scoring | Algorithmic change. Current impl uses only closest SPM + closest CSPM. Paper suggests considering multiple. ADR needed. |
| (add rows) | (student-filed issues) | (context from the students who filed them) |

4. **Tool configuration handoff**: Document the team's development infrastructure for the next cohort:
   - Project context files: what's in them, how they shaped agent behavior, what the next team should update
   - CI/CD pipeline: what checks run, how to add new ones, known limitations
   - Review process: the three-layer protocol (CI + human + LLM adversarial), the rotation system, what each layer catches
   - ADRs written this cohort: list them with one-line summaries so the next team knows what decisions are settled

5. **What we learned about LLM-assisted development and project management**: 3-5 bullet points each on:
   - Agentic engineering vs. vibe coding: concrete examples of when each happened, what the consequences were, and what habits helped you stay in the agentic engineering mode
   - Which agentic tool patterns were most helpful and which led you astray
   - How agent planning tools compared to hand-written specs and manual review
   - How the progressive LLM usage restriction affected your learning (would you change the progression?)
   - Which project management artifacts (project context files, ADRs, roadmaps) were most useful in practice
   - Advice for the next cohort on working with AI tools and maintaining project artifacts

> **Beyond this project:** A handoff document is communication to people you'll never meet, arriving with no context. This is the highest form of professional writing: making your knowledge useful to strangers. You'll do this every time you switch teams, onboard a replacement, or leave a role.

### Solo Work (week 6)

**Final push.** Ship anything that's close to done. Close or reassign anything that isn't. Leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.

Note: Issue numbers above are from the `ICICLE-ai/Food-Access-Model` repo unless prefixed with "frontend" (from `ICICLE-ai/FASS-Frontend`).

## Student Assignment Strategy

With 5 students of varying experience, assign based on challenge level:

| Role | Experience | Weeks 2-3 Focus | Weeks 4-5 Focus |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Student A (J) | Freshman/sophomore | #18 (type hints, ABM) | Frontend #36 (reporting view, paired with C) |
| Student B (J) | Freshman/sophomore | #24 (linting + CI) | #63 (unit conversions) + security checklist + frontend #10 (env var) |
| Student C (J/S) | Mid-level | #19 (type hints, API) + #50 (logging) | #94 (reporting API, paired with A) + #79 (backend metrics) |
| Student D (S) | Junior/senior | First tests + #47 (bug fix) | #91 (MFAI algorithm improvement) |
| Student E (S) | Junior/senior | #20 (preprocessing) + #27 (redundancy) | #67 (spatial refactor) + #74 (optimization) |

Pair J and S students on cross-cutting work (e.g., #94 backend + #79 frontend).

## LLM Usage and Tooling Progression

| Week | Tool/Process Milestones | Allowed LLM Usage | Not Yet |
|------|------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | CLI agent installed. Project context file created. Project mgmt artifacts introduced. Deployment configuration mental model introduced. | Ask for explanations of existing code. Compare tool responses. | Code generation |
| 2 | CI pipeline live. Peer review required. First ADR written (linting student). Iterative code quality pattern introduced. Structured planning previewed (demonstrated, not yet used independently). | Edge case brainstorming, type hint questions, "what does this error mean." ADR drafting assistance (student owns the decision). Interactive code refinement (push back on complexity, ask for best practices). | Writing functions, writing tests, using planning tools independently |
| 3 | Full 3-layer review pipeline (CI + human + LLM adversarial). ADR-format specs for design decisions. Agent planning introduced for single-feature implementation. | Spec review ("interview me about my approach"), adversarial PR review rotation. Use agent planning to cross-check hand-written specs. | "Fix this bug for me." Using plan output without reviewing it. Multi-issue planning. |
| 4 | LLM-generated ADRs from diffs/PRs (compare to manual). Multi-issue planning and branch-level review introduced for project-level scaffolding. Roadmap maintenance. Context file updates. | Design discussion ("what are the tradeoffs of X vs Y"), small code generation with spec. Auto-generate ADR drafts, then review and edit. Use planning tools independently for feature work. Multi-issue planning. Branch-level review. | Generating without a spec. Skipping hand-written specs entirely in favor of agent planning. |
| 5-6 | Review pipeline retrospective. Branch-level review evaluated for pre-merge checklist. Deployment configuration audit. Tool and process audit. Tool config handoff. | Full workflow, adversarial security review. Choose manual vs. assisted artifact generation based on decision complexity. Choose between manual specs and agent planning based on scope. | n/a, full access earned |

The progression matters because students need to build the muscle of *thinking first* before they get the power of *generating*. A freshman who learns to generate code in week 1 will never learn to read code. A senior who is forced to read code in week 1 will use generation more effectively later.

Across all weeks, the "write for future you" principle applies: when students use AI tools to produce code, their job is to iteratively refine the output until it is functional, readable, and no more complex than necessary. The tool is a collaborator in achieving code quality, not a shortcut past it.

The tooling progression runs in parallel: tools are set up early (Week 1), processes build incrementally (CI in Week 2, full review pipeline in Week 3, artifact generation in Week 4), and the team reflects on and adjusts their processes in Weeks 5-6.

## Coordination Mechanics

**Weekly rhythm:**
- **Group session** (~2 hours): Lesson (30-45 min, varies by week) + roadmap check (10 min) + guided work (remaining time)
- **Solo work** (async, later in the week): Self-directed work applying that week's patterns
- **Friday**: PRs due for review (both assigned and solo work)
- **Before next session**: Reviews completed so PRs can merge

**Issue discipline:**
- Every problem, question, or improvement idea gets a GitHub issue. No exceptions.
- Issues must have: clear title, description of the problem, affected files, and (when applicable) a proposed approach
- Students claim issues by commenting before starting work
- Stale claims (no PR within a week) get unclaimed so others can pick them up

**PR rules:**
- Max ~200 lines of changed code (non-test). Smaller is better.
- Must include: summary, what was tested, one tradeoff considered
- Must link to the issue it addresses
- Must pass CI checks (starting week 2, once linting workflow is merged)
- Must be reviewed by one peer (starting week 2) + one adversarial LLM review (starting week 3)

**Communication:**
- GitHub Issues for technical discussion (keeps it with the code)
- Short standup at start of each group session: "What I shipped, what's blocking me, what I filed"

**Branch strategy** (see the Week 2 Git Workflow scaffold above for the full guide):
- `main` is stable (deployed)
- `dev` is integration
- Feature branches off `dev`, named `feature/issue-NUMBER-short-desc`
- PRs merge to `dev`; `dev` merges to `main` at end of week 6

- Can use agent planning tools for feature-level implementation mapping, multi-issue coordination, and branch-level review
- Can write meaningful tests (not just happy-path)
- Fluent with at least one CLI agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or equivalent); know when to use agentic tools and when not to
- Understand the deployment topology: how frontend, backend, and database connect across environments, and how to configure each
- Understand and can maintain project management artifacts (project context files, ADRs, roadmaps)
- Have shipped real features through a real PR workflow with a three-layer review pipeline
- Can do adversarial code review (with and without LLM assistance)
- Can set up and operate CI checks, peer review, and LLM-assisted review as part of a team workflow
- Have filed, triaged, and prioritized real issues on a real project
- Can self-direct: identify what needs doing, scope it, and ship it
- Have a portfolio-worthy open source contribution
- Left a roadmap and tool configuration that makes the next cohort's onboarding faster

## Appendix A: Scaffolded Guide Template

Each guide follows this structure:

```
## [Issue Title] (#NUMBER)

### Context
What the issue is about and why it matters. 2-3 sentences.

### Before You Start
- [ ] Read these files: [list]
- [ ] Understand: [specific concept]
- [ ] Branch: feature/issue-NUMBER-short-desc

### Steps
1. First step (with expected output)
2. Second step
   - Sub-detail if needed
3. ...

### LLM Usage
What you CAN ask the LLM for this task.
What you should NOT ask the LLM for this task.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Flake8 clean
- [ ] PR opened with summary and test plan
- [ ] Peer review requested

### While You're In There
Things to look for while working in these files that could
become new issues (file them!):
- Missing type hints on adjacent functions
- Hardcoded values that should be constants
- Dead code or unused imports
- Missing error handling
- Anything that confused you (if it confused you, it'll confuse
  the next person -- file an issue to improve it)

### Stretch Goals (if you finish early)
Optional harder extensions of the same work.
```

Guides live in `docs/guides/` in the repo so future cohorts can reuse and improve them.

## Appendix B: The Solo Work Progression

The solo work sections are designed to ramp from "apply what you just learned" to "find and drive your own work":

| Week | Solo Work Mode | Decision Authority | Issue Creation |
|------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Observe + report**: File issues for everything found during traces | None (reporting only) | Required: 3+ issues per student |
| 2 | **Repeat the pattern**: Apply the same skill (type hints, tests, linting) to new files | Choose which files to work on | Encouraged: file anything you notice |
| 3 | **Pick from backlog**: Choose an issue, write a plan, implement it | Choose what to work on; plan must be posted before coding | Expected: file issues found during bug investigation |
| 4 | **Propose + execute**: File new issues based on what you discover, then work them | Full: choose what to build, write the spec | Required: 1+ new issue filed |
| 5 | **Full autonomy**: Ship the highest-impact thing you can identify | Full: prioritize, scope, implement, review | Expected: tag issues for next cohort |
| 6 | **Final push + handoff**: Close everything you can, document everything you can't | Full | Required: contribute to ROADMAP.md |

The transition from "assigned work with scaffolding" to "self-directed work with full autonomy" should feel gradual. If a student is struggling with solo work in weeks 3-4, pair them with someone more experienced. If a student is racing ahead, point them at the harder backlog issues (#42, #44, #51) and let them scope an approach even if implementation happens next cohort.
